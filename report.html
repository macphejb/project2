    <h1>Project 2 Report</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>My service emulates a shopping cart for an online store. There are parameters for the product name and manufacturer as well as for the number of units in the cart and the price of the item.</li>
        <li>I used mySQL for my database.</li>
        <li>I used express for my web service.</li>
        <li>You should be there now.</li>
        <li>I think endpoint and parameter names are pretty appropriate.</li>
        <li>Yes, data is sent as JSON.</li>
        <li>My service uses GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE.</li>
        <li>Firewall seems to be working.</li>
        <li>Done.</li>
        <li>I think this works.</li>
        <li>The web service is always running via pm2.</li>
        <li>The repo is shared.</li>
        <li>Schema and creation file are included,</li>
        <li>Admittedly, I was caught up earlier in the week with another project so most of my commits happened on the days right before the due date. Still, they were steady from then on.</li>
        <li>Evidently, the report page works. Sorry it's not that pretty.</li>
    </ol>
